# Make Change Project

## Description
This is my very first Java project while at Skill Distillery.
I have 3 methods in my project:
-main method
-printMenu()
-(nested) makeChange()

*The printMenu() allowed me to input a while loop to loop my menu
*The makeChange is where the magic happened.
*I performed the calculations here along with some if /else if statements to vary
the output messages needed for the exact change amount to be correct and efficient.
*exactChangeNeeded% - allowed for the program to filter out which denomination was needed.


## What I learned
Throughout this process I learned how to efficiently use:
-the printf()
-% in reference to filter out information needed in a variable
-how to nest methods in methods to make readable ("Code is read more often
than written!")
-comments to set up my code as a step-by-step methods

I also learned how awesome TA Saturdays are especially as a beginner!



### Technologies Used
Java, Eclpise, Git, Google

### What I Enjoyed
I enjoy the overall learning process. I enjoy when the information that I over-
loaded on during the week starts to click in place while I'm coding.
I also enjoy when the roadblocks in my brain stop & my code starts to produce
results!
